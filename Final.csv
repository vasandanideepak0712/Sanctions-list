Alexey ALEXANDROV,16/06/81,,,,,FSB Operative attached to Criminalistics Institute,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0018. (UK Statement of Reasons):Alexey Alexandrov is an FSB operative in the Criminalistics Institute - Military Unit 34435. Evidence including phone and travel records suggest that Alexey Alexandrov was one of the operatives involved in the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny during his August 2020 visit to Siberia. A chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. Alexandrov was an operative of the Criminalistics Unit present in Tomsk where Navalny was poisoned. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents.  Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Alexey Alexandrov in his capacity as an operative in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, was present in Tomsk at the time of the poisoning and was one of the key operatives responsible for the preparation and use of a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.",Individual,14132,

(UK Statement of Reasons):Judge Vitaly BELITSKY is an involved person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019.  BELITSKY was one of three judges who presided over the politically motivated trial of Vladimir Kara-Murza on charges including disseminating false information about the Russian Army under part 2 of article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. The prosecution of Kara-Murza is widely considered to be politically motivated. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. BELITSKY’s role as a judge in the trial of Kara-Murza shows that he is providing support for this policy. Therefore, BELITSKY is an involved person because he is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Vladimir Mikhailovich BOGDANOV,,,,,,former Director of Criminalistics Institute. Head of FSB Special Technology Centre (parent entity of Criminalistics Institute),,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0021. (UK Statement of Reasons):Vladimir Bogdanov is the head of the FSB's 'Special Technology Centre' (the parent entity of the FSB's Criminalistics Institute - Military Unit 34435). There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent and as head of the FSB's 'Special Technology Centre' Bogdanov has responsibility for, provided support for, or promoted the actions of the operatives who carried out the operation. Alternatively, he is associated with those who carried out the operation. Evidence suggests that Vladimir Bogdanov was in close contact with Stanislav Makshakov, the commander of the team of operatives involved in the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny. This designation is part of a further package of designations targeting the FSB operatives directly involved in carrying out the operation. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. (Gender):Male",Individual,14135,

Aleksandr Vasilievich BORTNIKOV,15/11/51,Perm,Russia,,,Director of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0014. (UK Statement of Reasons):Alexander Bortnikov is the director of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation and, therefore, responsible for the activities conducted by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given the role of the FSB, and the extent of surveillance, there are therefore reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent. As director of the Federal Security Service, Alexander Bortnikov bears responsibility for the preparation and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.

Ahmadi-Moqaddam underlined that the Cyber Police would take on anti-revolutionary and dissident groups who used internet-based social networks in 2009 to trigger protests against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In January 2012, the Cyber Police issued new guidelines for internet cafés, requiring users to provide personal information that would be kept by café owners for six months, as well as a record of the websites they visited. The rules also require café owners to install closed-circuit television cameras and maintain the recordings for six months. These new rules may create a logbook that authorities can use to track down activists or whoever is deemed a threat to national security. In June 2012, Iranian media reported that the Cyber Police would be launching a crackdown on virtual private networks (VPNs). On 30 October 2012, the Cyber Police arrested the blogger Sattar Beheshti without a warrant for ‘actions against national security on social networks and Facebook’. Beheshti had criticised the Iranian government in his blog. Beheshti was found dead in his prison cell on 3 November 2012, and is believed to have been tortured to death by the Cyber Police authorities.

"FEDERAL STATE UNITARY ENTERPRISE ""STATE RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY"" (GOSNIIOKHT)",,,,,,,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0017. (UK Statement of Reasons):The Federal State Unitary Enterprise State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology (Gosniiokht) is a state research institute within Russia with responsibility for the destruction of chemical weapon stocks inherited from the Soviet Union. The institute in its original role, before 1994, was involved in the development and production of chemical weapons, including the toxic nerve agent now known as ‘Novichok’. After 1994, the same family who owned the institute took part in the government’s program for destruction of the stocks of chemical weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. The subsequent deployment of a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group against Alexey Navalny would therefore only be possible because the institute had failed to carry out its responsibility to destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. As the institute responsible for the destruction of chemical weapons within the Russian Federation, Gosniiokht bears responsibility for the preparation and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.

Sergei Vladilenovich KIRIYENKO,26/07/62,Sukhumi,Russia,,,First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0012. (UK Statement of Reasons):As First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kiriyenko is responsible for domestic affairs. The Presidential Office is a state body within Russia that provides support for the President’s work, monitors the implementation of the President’s decisions, and has responsibility for governmental policy and the regime’s most important actions domestically. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexei Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020 were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given the role of the state within the attack, and the scale of the operation against Navalny, it is reasonable to conclude that the poisoning of Alexey Navalny was only possible with the consent of the Presidential Executive Office.

Aleksei Yurievich KRIVORUCHKO,17/07/75,Stavropol,Russia,,,Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0016. (UK Statement of Reasons):Aleksei Krivoruchko is the Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. In this capacity, he has overall responsibility for armaments. This includes the overisight of the Ministry’s stocks of weapons and military equipment. This includes the oversight of the Ministry’s stocks of weapons and military equipment. The Russian Ministry of Defence took on the responsibility for the chemical weapons stocks inherited from the Soviet Union and their safe storage until their destruction could be completed. The Russian Ministry of Defence has overall responsibility for the safe storage and destruction of chemical weapons. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. Given the use of such chemical weapons in the territory of the Russian Federation and the evidence of the continued involvement of the Russian MoD in the Novichok programme, this could only be on account of intent by the Ministry of Defence and its political leadership. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given Aleksei Krivoruchko’s senior role in the Russian military, the evidence suggests that he is responsible for the preparation and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.

Financial sanctions imposed in addition to an asset freeze: Trust services. Date trust services sanctions imposed: 21/03/2023. (UK Statement of Reasons):DMITRI ALEKSEEVICH LEBEDEV, hereafter LEBEDEV, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors at Bank Rossiya and Managing Director and Co-Chairman of the Board of Management of ABR Management, and a member of Board of Directors of SOGAZ JSC, (both of whom are affiliates of Bank Rossiya), one of Russia's largest insurers. As Chairman of the Board of Directors at Bank Rossiya and a Member of the Board of Directors at SOGAZ, he is involved in carrying on business in a sector (financial services) of strategic significance to the Russian Government. Bank Rossiya is a Russian bank privately owned by elite Russian billionaires with direct links to Vladimir Putin. Since the annexation of Crimea, Bank Rossiya has opened branches across Crimea and Sevastopol, and provided travel cards for the public to travel across the peninsula thereby supporting the integration of Crimea and Sevastopol into the Russian Federation through the financial system. Bank Rossiya has also contributed to the provision of insurance and investment throughout Crimea and Sevastopol and services to support military capability and major transport links. SOGAZ JSC, the largest insurer in the Russian corporate sector, insured the construction of the railway infrastructure connecting the bridge over the Kerch Strait and the Port of Taman and reinsured the construction of the bridge over the Kerch Strait between the Russian mainland and the Crimean peninsula. In doing so, SOGAZ supported the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula into the Russian Federation which in turn further undermined the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. LEBEDEV therefore is involved in carrying on business in a sector of strategic significance to the Russian Government, has obtained a benefit from or is supporting the Russian Government by working as a director or equivalent of a company which carries on business in sectors of strategic significance (financial services) to the Government of Russia, and has supported activities which destabilise Ukraine and undermine and threaten its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

This law was enacted as a result of, and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of, a Russian Government policy aimed at preventing the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine and intimidating those willing to criticise it and to provide accurate information about the conflict. This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict, anti-war sentiment and dissent that would undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war by reducing the support of the Russian population. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine. LENSKAYA’s decision to grant the request for the arrest of Vladimir Kara-Murza amounts to providing support for this policy.

This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.

Stanislav Valentinovich MAKSHAKOV,01/01/66,,,,,"Deputy Director, Criminalistics Institute, FSB.",,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0023. (UK Statement of Reasons):Stanislav Makshakov is a deputy director in the FSB's Criminalistics Institute - Military Unit 34435. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent. Evidence including phone records suggest that Stanislav Makshakov was the commander of the team of operatives involved in the use of chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny. As Deputy Director he is responsible for and/or engaged in, provided support for or promoted the activities conducted by this unit in the FSB. Alternatively, he is associated with those who did. This designation is part of a package of designations targeting the FSB team involved. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack.",Individual,14137,

(UK Statement of Reasons):Currently Head of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. Sergei Menyailo was until April 2021 the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District and, therefore, responsible for ensuring the implementation of the constitutional powers of the President, including the implementation by public authorities of domestic and foreign policy of the state in the federal district of Siberia. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August, were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation. The poisoning of Alexey Navalny took place at Tomsk Bogashevo airport in Siberia. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack.  Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given the scale of the operation involved, it is reasonable to conclude that the poisoning was only possible with the consent of the Presidential Office. Given his senior leadership role in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menyailo bears responsibility for the providing support for the preparation and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny in Tomsk, Siberia.

The enactment of this law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of a Russian Government policy aimed at preventing the Russian public from knowing the truth about and intimidating those willing to criticise and provide accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine.  This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, as well as anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for the war and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

(b) natural persons whose action, policies or activities otherwise undermine democracy or the rule of law in Venezuela. There is reliable evidence that Mora is directly responsible for issuing the arbitrary arrests of Parliamentarians, with Parliamentary Immunity. There is a considerable amount of diverse evidence reporting Mora as the prosecutor for at least four people with Parliamentary Immunity – Requesens, Borges, Alban, and Marrero, making him responsible by virtue of his position for undermining democracy and the rule of law, and repressing democratic opposition. Mora was the prosecutor for the case of Fernando Alban, where the defendant died under suspicious circumstances. There is reliable evidence that Mora participated in Alban’s autopsy, saw visible signs of torture, and announced an incorrect cause of death to cover this up. According to multiple allegations, some first-hand accounts, he has been witness to the torture of multiple prisoners, some of whom he was prosecutor for.

(UK Statement of Reasons):Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief FANB, Deputy Minister of Monitoring and Inspection of Government Administration, and Secretary General of the National Defence Council (SECODENA). José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira has been Second in Command and Chief of Staff of Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (CEOFANB) since June 2017, having been appointed to the post by Nicolas Maduro. The CEOFANB is the highest point of command in the Venezuelan armed forces. The CEOFANB sets the strategic direction of all strands of the Venezuelan military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Guard (GNB)), coordinates them, and implements operations. Since September 2020, Ornelas has been the Chief of the General Staff to the Commander in Chief. There is reliable evidence that the GNB has committed serious human rights violations during Ferreira’s period in charge. A report by OHCHR in 2018 documents incidents of people deprived of their liberty and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and (in many cases possibly) torture, reportedly carried out in part by the GNB.  Some of these incidents occurred in the period that Ferreira has held the position of Commander of the CEOFANB. As a commander of the CEOFANB, and Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief and Strategic Command Operations, and thus in charge of the GNB, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those acts. There is reliable evidence that the GNB used excessive force against people in the Pemon territory in February 2019, including killing three people, and carried out extrajudicial killings of an alleged terrorist group in El Junquito, Caracas. As a CEOFANB Commander and Chief of Staff at the time, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those grave human rights violations. Finally, there is reliable evidence that In May 2019 members of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB), which sits under the command of the CEOFANB, during Ferreira’s time in role, used tear gas to disperse a march of opposition supporters.  Due to his role, Ferreira is partially responsible for this repression of civil society and violation of freedom of expression. (Gender):Male",Individual,13841,

Ivan Vladimirovich OSIPOV,21/08/76,,,,,FSB Operative attached to Criminalistics Institute,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0020. (UK Statement of Reasons):Ivan Osipov is an FSB operative in the Criminalistics Institute - Military Unit 34435. Evidence including phone and travel records suggest that Ivan Osipov was one of the operatives involved in the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny during his August 2020 visit to Siberia. A chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. Osipov was an operative of the Criminalistics Unit present in Tomsk where Navalny was poisoned. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ivan Osipov, in his capacity as an operative in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, was present in Tomsk at the time of the poisoning and was one of the key operatives responsible for the preparation and use of a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.",Individual,14134,

Vladimir PANYAEV,25/11/80,Serdobsk,Russia,,,FSB Member,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0019. (UK Statement of Reasons):Vladimir Panyaev is a member of the FSB. Evidence including phone and travel records suggest that Vladimir Panyaev was present during the use of a chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny during his August 2020 visit to Siberia. A chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. Vladimir Panyaev was an FSB member who was present in Tomsk where Navalny was poisoned. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Vladimir Panyaev in his capacity as a member of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, was present in Tomsk at the time of the poisoning and was one of the key figures responsible for the preparation and use of a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.",Individual,14133,

Pavel Anatolievich POPOV,01/01/57,Krasnoyarsk,Russia,,,Deputy Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0015. (UK Statement of Reasons):Pavel Popov is the Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. In this capacity, he has overall responsibility for research activities. This includes the oversight and development of the Ministry’s scientific and technical capabilities, including the development of potential weapons, and modernisation of existing weapons and military equipment. The Russian Ministry of Defence took on the responsibility for the chemical weapons stocks inherited from the Soviet Union and their safe storage until their destruction could be completed. The Russian Ministry of Defence has overall responsibility for the safe storage and destruction of chemical weapons. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. Given the use of such chemical weapons in the territory of the Russian Federation and the evidence of the continued involvement of the Russian MoD in the Novichok programme, this could only be on account of intent by the Ministry of Defence and its political leadership, which includes Pavel Popov. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given Pavel Popov’s senior role in the Russian military, the evidence suggests that he is responsible for the preparation and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.

Anna Evgenievna POTYCHKO,28/07/72,,Russia,,,Lawyer - General Prosecutor’s Office,"The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation, str. Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 15a,, GSP-3, Moscow","(UK Sanctions List Ref):RUS1946. Financial sanctions imposed in addition to an asset freeze: Trust services. Date trust services sanctions imposed: 31/07/2023. (UK Statement of Reasons):State Prosecutor Anna Evgenievna POTYCHKO is an involved person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. First, POTYCHKO was part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Vladimir Kara-Murza, appearing in the Moscow City Court for the prosecution on 18 May 2022, arguing against the defence’s appeal from the order of the District Court to keep Kara-Murza in custody during the trial. Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges, including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. POTYCHKO was also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya Yashin under the same law, and made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from expressing anti-war views to journalists during those proceedings. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine. This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, as well as anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for the war and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. POTYCHKO’s involvement as part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, her appearance on behalf of the prosecution to oppose the appeal against preventative detention, and her involvement in and statement regarding the proceedings against Yashin demonstrate that she  is an involved person because she is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Second, POTYCHKO is associated with an involved person, namely, Andrey Zadachin. Zadachin was designated by the UK Government on 21 April 2023 for his role as investigator in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza. Zadachin and POTYCHKO were both part of the prosecution team for the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, and therefore hold, or have held, a professional association.

Alexei Semenovich SEDOV,01/01/54,,,,,Head of FSB 2nd Service,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0024. (UK Statement of Reasons):Alexei Sedov is the Head of the ""2nd Service"" Unit in the Federal Security of the Russian Federation (FSB). There is reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent. As Head of the ""2nd Service"" Unit, Sedov is responsible for, engaged in, provided support for, or promoted the activities conducted by this unit in the FSB. Alternatively, he is associated with those who did. This designation is part of a further package of designations targeting the FSB operatives directly involved in carrying out the operation. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. (Gender):Male",Individual,14138,

Kirill VASILYEV,,,,,,"Director of Criminalistics Institute, FSB",,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0022. (UK Statement of Reasons):Kirill Vasilyev is the Director of the Criminalistics Institute of the FSB - Military Unit 34435. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent. Evidence demonstrates that the Criminalistics Institute were the unit responsible for, provided support for and involved in the use of chemical weapon in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny. As Director for the Criminalistics Institute Vasilyev was responsible for the actions of the unit responsible. Alternatively, he is associated with the operatives who did. This designation is part of a further package of designations targeting the FSB operatives directly involved in carrying out the operation. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. (Gender):Male",Individual,14136,

Prophane Victor served in the most recent National Assembly (2016-2020) where he was Member of Parliament (deputé) for Petite Riviere, Artibonite department, an area with increasing levels of violence and gang control.

Andrei Veniaminovich YARIN,13/02/70,"Nizhny Tagil, Sverdlovsk Oblast",Russia,,,Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate,,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):CHW0011. (UK Statement of Reasons):Andrei Veniaminovich Yarin is the Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate in the Presidential Executive Office. The Presidential Office is a state body providing support for the President’s work and monitoring the implementation of the President’s decisions and overall Governmental policies and most important action. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation, including the Federal Security Service (FSB). Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given the role of the state within the attack, and the scale of the operation against Navalny, it is reasonable to conclude that the poisoning of Alexey Navalny was only possible with the consent of the Presidential Executive Office. As Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate in the Presidential Executive Office, Andrei Veniaminovich Yarin bears responsibility for the preparation, support for and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny.
